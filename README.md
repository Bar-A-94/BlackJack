# BlackJack
Explore the world of probability theory and reinforcement learning while having fun with Blackjack!    
This Python project provides a comprehensive implementation of the classic card game and probabilities/reinforcement learning ideas.    

## Features:

Basic Blackjack Game: Play Blackjack with a fully functional card game engine.   
Probability Calculations: Dive into the math behind the game, calculating probabilities of various outcomes.  
Reinforcement Learning Agent: Train and challenge an RL agent to improve its Blackjack strategy.   
Interactive Interface: Enjoy a user-friendly interface to play Blackjack against the RL agent or watch it learn.  

## Key Learning Opportunities:

Gain insights into probability theory and its applications in card games - more information inside Players/TablePlayers folder - README.md    
Develop and train a reinforcement learning agent from scratch  - more information inside Players/RLPlayers folder - README.md   
Explore RL algorithms and strategies to optimize decision-making.   

## Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.  
Install the required Python dependencies.  
Start playing Blackjack by main.py, or set up RL training sessions by Train_and_compare.py!
