## Rules of BlackJack
Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over a total of 21. Here are the rules of Blackjack with the restriction that you can only perform one split per hand:

## Object of the Game
The primary goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

## Card Values
Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.  
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.  
An Ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.  
## Game Setup
Players are dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer receives one card face-up (upcard) and one card face-down (hole card).  
## Player's Turn
### Options
Hit: Request an additional card to increase your hand total. You can continue hitting until you decide to stand or until your hand exceeds 21 (bust).   
Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.   
Double Down: Double your initial bet, receive one more card, and then stand.   
Split: If you have two cards of the same rank (e.g., two 7s or two 10s), you can choose to split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet. After splitting, you'll receive one additional card for each hand, and you can then play each hand separately.    
Players are allowed to perform only one split per hand.
### Additional Rules
If you split any other pair (e.g., 7-7) and then receive a 10-value card on one of the split hands, it's considered a regular 21, not a Blackjack.
## Dealer's Turn
Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card.  
The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher.   
The dealer must stand on "soft 17" (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11), but must hit on "hard 17" (a hand without an Ace or with an Ace valued as 1).   
## Winning and Payouts
If the player's hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, the player wins and is typically paid 1:1 on their bet.  
If the player has a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) and the dealer does not, the player is usually paid 3:2 on their bet.   
If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), all remaining players win.   
## Ties
If the player and dealer have the same hand total (a push), the player's bet is returned.   

These are the fundamental rules of Blackjack with the condition that you can only split once per hand. It's important to note that specific casino rules and variations may apply, so it's recommended to check the house rules before playing in a casino or implementing the game in a project.
